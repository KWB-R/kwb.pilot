The site panel (Figure 28) provides a map (based on Leaflet and OpenStreetMap) 
of the location of the AQUANES site Haridwar in the world (top) and on a local 
level (bottom). 

```{r site_tab_panel, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/28.png")
```


Note: 
The coordinates and the popup menu used for the two maps can be modified by the 
user, which is described in Chapter 4.1.3.
